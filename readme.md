# Yeti adaptors

A collection of adaptors so you can use Yahoo's [Yeti](https://github.com/yui/yeti) tool with other unit testing frameworks.

To find out how you can use them navigate to the unit testing framework you use.

I've only done adaptors for jasmine and QUnit, but if you use another framework feel free to fork and add it in the same style as the other examples.
